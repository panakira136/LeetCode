# Algorithm Practice & LeetCode Solutions
This repository contains my personal record of solving algorithm problems from LeetCode (and other platforms).  
Each solution includes:
- Problem statement (short description)
- My thought process and step-by-step explanation
- Clean and optimized Python code with type hints
- Complexity analysis (time & space)
